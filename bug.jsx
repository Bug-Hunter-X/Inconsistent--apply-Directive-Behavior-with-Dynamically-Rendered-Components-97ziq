The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a component's style tag, particularly when the component is dynamically rendered.  The problem is that the `@apply` directive seems to fail to apply the desired styles when the component is initially rendered, resulting in the styles being absent until some sort of state change (e.g. a re-render) occurs. This is inconsistent with statically rendered components, where `@apply` works correctly.
